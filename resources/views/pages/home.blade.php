			<h1>Hi. I'm Tim &mdash; a full-stack web developer in San Diego, CA.</h1>
			<h4 class="section-title">A little about me...</h4>
			<p>I never expected to be a developer &mdash; I received a degree in economics, and spent a lot of time doing maths. But never one to turn down a challenge, I started writing code to help friends and businesses build websites. From there I kept learning &ndash; to help integrate disparate computer systems, and to incorporate more server technology.</p>
			<p>Since then I have spent the last decade working as a full-stack web developer for and with agencies and businesses throughout San Diego</p>
